# National Gallery Of Art Data Analysis Project

## Project Description

This project focuses on using SQL to extract insights from the National Gallery of Art (NGA) dataset. As part of their [open data program](https://www.nga.gov/open-access-images/open-data.html), the NGA offers 17 CSV files and an Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD). I will create a SQLite database from these CSV files, perform data analysis with SQL, and visualize the results using Python. 

## Project Questions

The project seeks to answer the following questions:

**Timeframe of Artworks:** What timeframe or time period are most of the artworks created from?

**Prolific Artists:** Who are the artists with the most works at the NGA? 

**Artwork Types:** What is the breakdown of the types of artworks in the NGA collection? (e.g., painting, print, sculpture, photograph, etc.)

**Origins of Artworks:** Where were most of these artworks sourced from? (e.g., collections, funds, donors)

**Top Donors:** Who are the most active donors to the NGA?

**Canadian Artists:** How many Canadian artists are represented in the NGA collection?

**Canadian Artworks:** How many total art pieces are attributed to Canadian artists?

**Types of Canadian Artworks:** What is the breakdown of the types of artworks by Canadian artists? (e.g., painting, print, sculpture, photograph, etc.)

**Time Period of Canadian Artworks:** In which time period were these artworks by Canadian artists predominantly created?

## Project Execution

**Data Collection and Database Creation:** Use the provided CSV files and the ERD as a guide to create the SQLite database.

**SQL Data Analysis:** Write SQL queries to extract data to answer the project questions.

**Data Visualization:** Use Python to create visualizations that illustrate the findings.

**Report Generation:** Summarize the results and insights gained from the analysis in a final PowerPoint report.
